## UX

### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

GymBeam target users are:
* Aged 15-60
* Gym lovers trying to discover their potential
* People interested in fitness, healthy diet, martial arts, running or bycicle sessions
* Have an interest to reach new goals, motivation to reach a higher level of themselves

What these users would be looking for:
* Clear and easy-to-find information
* Beautiful photos that provide inspiration and make the destinations look desirable
* Facilities, special offers and classses to try use to

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. An effort was taken to not provide an overwhelming amount of information at first glance as this is often the reason people are put off with local gyms.

Due to the age group of the users, it is assumed that most users will be viewing the site not only on their mobile phones, but also on the tablets or computers. Therefore, creating something responsive is integral to the design.

### **Scope**

In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features will be included in this release:

- Logo, header and menu bar, to navigate to various sections of the page
- Hero image section with inspirational quote
- Discover section below including short information about the gym
- Personal training section with desirable text
- Section with offer and pop-up window to sign up for newsletter
- Section with facilites and popular classes
- Follow up section with button linked to contact page
- Footer with brief information, quick links and opening times
- Dedicated webpage for students offer
- Dedicated webpage for gallery of images from the gym
- Dedicated webpage for contact form with address and phone number
- Links to affiliate social media pages in the footer

### **Structure** 

This is a multi-page website to give more space for dedicated pages. 

Users can simply scroll through the information as it is displayed or they can use the navigation bar at the top which allows them to easily move to whatever webpage of the site they are interested in. I chose the following order for the information 'Home > Students > Gallery > Contact, as I felt this would allow the information to be digested in the best way. The text blocks are enriched with images to ensure interest is kept and there is no information overload at any point. Finally, there is a simple contact form for users to be able to reach us with any questions.

### **Skeleton**

Whilst building the website I felt that there were sections with too much information about prices, classes and coaches. For this reason, I shortened or deleted some of the content of sections and simply added section with facilities using FontAwesome icons, newsletter section and follow-up contact us section. I felt it provides the user a positive user experience, it's easier to 'digest' the content while scrolling through images with less text information.

However, if user needs additional information before visiting us, he can simply contact us thanks to contact page where we can briefly answer any questions.

I also decided to resize my images in gallery by 50% to make them smaller and change their format to webp, as I felt it looked cleaner and improved the loading phase of our page. It also allowed for better responsiveness and the images looked better.

### **Surface**

I chose a colour palette based around white & black as these colours are elegant and simple to implement into design with more images on the webapge. I paired these with a lighter red colour to show appropriate contrast. 

- `#000000` used for primary text or background
- `#fafafa` used for secondary text
- `#ec5353` used for primary highlights
- `#f5634b` and `#fe9418` for hover effects
- `93c3c3` for footer

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/000000-fafafa-ec5353-93c3c3-f5634b-fe9418) to help me generate my colour palette.

I used Google fonts 'Raleway' to design logo of website. I felt leaving font 'sans-serif' was a simple choice and stood out on the page in uppercase style.

- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) was used for the logo.

- [sans-serif](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/sans_serif) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the facility section or social media icons in the footer.
